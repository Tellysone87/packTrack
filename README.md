# Summary

PackTrack - An app that allows you to track all your packages on one page. I was inspired by a company named Route. I enjoy online shopping, but I hated joggling all of the separate tracking links.  This takes the hassle out of tracking packages by displaying the statuses in one place. The user can make an account, sign in and even reset their password if necessary. Once signed in, the user has the ability to enter tracking numbers. Just submit your tracking number and the status will be added to the table containing of all your current packages. You can also view the package history. I also implemented google maps to view the location of your package as well.
